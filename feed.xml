                <p>We’re going to talk about algorithms. The algorithms running into glide computers that proccess the data obtained from the different sensors to give you information about your climb/descent rate, glide ratio, wind speed and direction, thermal drift, best route, etc. All this information makes you fly safer and better.</p>
<p>This algorithms are behind all glide computers in the market. From glide computers based on specific purpose hardware to glide computer software running on general purpose hardware like tablets, phones, e-readers.</p>
<p>We think that a more in-depth understanding of the way these algorithms work will help you correctly use the information your glide computer gives to you.</p>
